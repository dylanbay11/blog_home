If you're seeing this post, you're ahead of the curve! Stay tuned for the next update, on a project to collect data about Epic's five-year free game giveaway experiment of over 400 games via web scraping and APIs.

<!-- Intro about Steam's dominance, a chart about that dominance

(also: Potential data or charts from various Epic Game Store Year in Review posts, aggregated?)

Story about EGS free games and their efforts, including biggest giveaways

Get down to brass tacks: explain initial list scraping and desire for more data

Problems faced trying to scrape links themselves

Solution (mostly): use wrapper for API (how much detail??), focus on thought process I think

(Optional) Problems faced with age restrictions, empty rows

Conclusion, hype for follow-up data, desire to fill in empty bits (Selenium?) -->

If you've ever played a video game on a computer, chances are you've used or heard of Steam. Launched in 2003 to distribute game studio Valve's own games, but later expanded to become a storefront for video games from third party developers, Steam became so wildly successful that today Valve practically gave up making its own games. Steam became so dominant in the space by the mid-2010s that even a few major studios splitting off and making their own launchers hardly seemed to matter, and in recent years some of those same studios (EA, for example) have come back to Steam, because that's where the money is. In 2013, for example, [one source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-04/valve-lines-up-console-partners-in-challenge-to-microsoft-sony) had Steam pegged at a whopping 75% market share. [Statistia](https://www.statista.com/topics/4282/steam/#topicOverview) estimates that even today Steam remains a behemoth, with over 10,000 new games in a single year and peaking at 10 billion dollars in revenue! The path to this windfall: taking a 30% cut from every sale on the platform, making Valve the ultimate PC gaming middle man.

Cue a challenge. Epic, both maker of popular game engines that power game graphics and physics, and publisher of smash 2017 hit Fortnite (itself estimated to have brought in [20 billion](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/94476/fortnite-made-over-20-billion-in-revenue/index.html) dollars in lifetime revenue), decided to follow a similar path, and expanded their own launcher to sell third-party games. The pitch? [Only a 12%](https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/12/04/tim-sweeney-answers-questions-about-the-new-epic-games-store) cut for Epic. At the end of 2018, an expanded amount of games went live.

The problem? 


<!-- If you're seeing this post, you're ahead of the curve! Stay tuned for the next update, on a project to collect data about Epic's five-year free game giveaway experiment of over 400 games via web scraping and APIs. -->

<!-- Intro about Steam's dominance, a chart about that dominance

(also: Potential data or charts from various Epic Game Store Year in Review posts, aggregated?)

Story about EGS free games and their efforts, including biggest giveaways

Get down to brass tacks: explain initial list scraping and desire for more data

Problems faced trying to scrape links themselves

Solution (mostly): use wrapper for API (how much detail??), focus on thought process I think

(Optional) Problems faced with age restrictions, empty rows

Conclusion, hype for follow-up data, desire to fill in empty bits (Selenium?) -->
